    Due to the increasing use of Discord by IPSA students to seek help and access study notes, a problem
       arose: those studying late at night often received no response, as notes were shared manually. The initial
       idea was to create an AI-powered Discord bot to provide notes based on student queries. However, to better
       fit the final project requirements, it was decided to develop a conversational chat website instead.`,
